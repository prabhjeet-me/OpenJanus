title: Bad Request — Wrong File, Wrong Lead
---

<h1>Bad Request — <br />Wrong File, Wrong Lead</h1>
<p>
  The system looked at your request, squinted, and said, “That doesn't make
  sense.” <br />
  Maybe a typo in the case file, maybe the wrong address, maybe just a bad
  hunch. <br />
  Either way, the paperwork didn't check out, and the server tossed it back
  across your desk. <br />
  Don't sweat it, detective — clean up the report and try again. Even the best
  make mistakes when the coffee runs low.
