title: Badge Rejected — You're Not on the List

<h1>Badge Rejected — <br />You're Not on the List</h1>
<p>
  You slid your credentials across the desk, but the guard just shook his head.
  “Not tonight.” <br />
  Maybe the password's wrong, maybe someone tampered with your ID, or maybe this
  place isn't meant for your eyes. <br />
  The door stays shut, the neon flickers, and the rain starts to fall. <br />
  Come back when your clearance checks out — or when you've got a better story.
